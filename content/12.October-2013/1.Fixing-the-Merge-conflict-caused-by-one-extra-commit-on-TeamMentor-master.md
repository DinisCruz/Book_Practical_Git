##  Fixing the Merge conflict caused by one extra commit on TeamMentor master

On the 3.4 Release of [TeamMentor](https://teammentor.net/) (which was the first release we really used [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) on development (see this great presentation on [Git Branching Model](http://blog.diniscruz.com/2013/05/great-presentation-on-git-branching.html)) we ended up with a situation where the commit that was the parent of all feature/fix branches was off-by-one the master of the [TeamMentor/Master](https://github.com/TeamMentor/Master) repository (we also had to do a bunch of back-porting of fixes into that commit, see [Git Flow - Moving patches from one Commit into another Commit post](http://blog.diniscruz.com/2013/09/git-flow-moving-patches-from-one-commit.html))

In practice this means that the [TeamMentor/Master](https://github.com/TeamMentor/Master) graph currently looks like this:  

![](images/image_thumb_25255B4_25255D1.png)

... with the master branch on the commit **fe26934d489e65660bd67be7811effcbccad1d19**  

![](images/image_thumb_25255B5_25255D1.png)

.. .and the 3_3_3_Hotfix branch on commit **b97a470ffa173d67a9c74373593eea03eb7a2da4**  

![](images/image_thumb_25255B6_25255D1.png)

But looking at the [TeamMentor/Dev](https://github.com/TeamMentor/Dev/) Graph

![](images/image_thumb_25255B7_25255D1.png)

...we can see that all commits (done on 'one branch per issue' workflow) have the **b97a470ffa173d67a9c74373593eea03eb7a2da4** commit as its parent (see image above and below)

![](images/image_thumb_25255B8_25255D1.png)

In practice this means that the final 3.4 release commit from the [TeamMentor/Dev](https://github.com/TeamMentor/Dev/) repo

![](images/image_thumb_25255B9_25255D1.png)

... is incompatible with the [TeamMentor/Master](https://github.com/TeamMentor/Master) repo (note that these could be branches of the same repo, but I like the use of separate repositories, since they provide a nice air-gap between development and production repositories)

Actually in principle they could be merged automatically if there was no conflicts!

But if we look at that extra commit from [TeamMentor/Master](https://github.com/TeamMentor/Master) repo (the [fe26934d489e65660bd67be7811effcbccad1d19](https://github.com/TeamMentor/Master/commit/fe26934d489e65660bd67be7811effcbccad1d19) one)

![](images/image_thumb_25255B10_25255D1.png)

... we see that the change was made on the version number (which in the 3.4 release will now say 3.4)

Note that GitHub will not allow a Pull Request to be made in cases like this, since GitHub has no online merge capabilities.

**Ok, so how do we solve this?**  

The solution is to:  


1. create a local branch pointing to **b97a470ffa173d67a9c74373593eea03eb7a2da4**
2. do a pull from [TeamMentor/Master](https://github.com/TeamMentor/Master) to get the [fe26934d489e65660bd67be7811effcbccad1d19](https://github.com/TeamMentor/Master/commit/fe26934d489e65660bd67be7811effcbccad1d19) commit
3. merge the current 3.4 code into [fe26934d489e65660bd67be7811effcbccad1d19](https://github.com/TeamMentor/Master/commit/fe26934d489e65660bd67be7811effcbccad1d19) (which will cause a conflict)
4. solve the conflict,
5. commit the result
6. push to GitHub into a new branch (called 3.4_Merge)
7. do a pull request (from 3.4_Merge into master)


In a local clone of [TeamMentor/Dev](https://github.com/TeamMentor/Dev/)   we start by to create a branch that is pointing to **b97a470ffa173d67a9c74373593eea03eb7a2da4**   

This can be done using the command: **$ git checkout **b97a470ffa173d67a9c74373593eea03eb7a2da4** **  

![](images/image_thumb_25255B12_25255D1.png)

Followed by (as the help says) with: **$ git checkout -b 3.4_Merge**  

![](images/image_thumb_25255B15_25255D1.png)

Next we do a pull from TeamMentor/Master using **$ git pull git@github.com:TeamMentor/Master.git master:3.4_Merge**  

![](images/image_thumb_25255B16_25255D1.png)

The command above is basically saying:

_Go to the **git@github.com:TeamMentor/Master.git** repo and merge/add the commits from its **master** branch into the local **3.4_Merge** branch_

Note how the line **_b97a470..fe26934  master     -> 3.4_Merge _**(from screenshot above) shows how we went form the **b97a470ffa173d67a9c74373593eea03eb7a2da4** commit to the **fe26934d489e65660bd67be7811effcbccad1d19 **commit

Next we merge into the **_3.4_Merge_** branch, the contents of the **master** branch (which contains the 3.4 code) using: **$ git merge master**  

![](images/image_thumb_25255B17_25255D1.png)

.... which predictably failed with a conflict on **_Settings.js_**  

**Solving git conflicts**  

My preferred UI to solve conflicts is the one provided by TortoiseGit, which you can access from here:

![](images/image_thumb_25255B26_25255D1.png)

... them on the popup window that shows up, double click on the conflicted file:

![](images/image_thumb_25255B27_25255D1.png)

... and on the TortoiseMerge GUI :

![](images/image_thumb_25255B28_25255D1.png)

... chose the option to **_Use 'theirs' text block_**  

![](images/image_thumb_25255B33_25255D1.png)

... which will update the bottom pane with the fixed version of Settings.js (in this case with no changes from before)

![](images/image_thumb_25255B34_25255D1.png)

Save the changes and chose yes to mark the file as resolved:

![](images/image_thumb_25255B35_25255D1.png)

Close the TortoiseMerge and (since there is no other conflicts) click OK on the Resolve GUI

![](images/image_thumb_25255B36_25255D1.png)

... another OK:

![](images/image_thumb_25255B37_25255D1.png)

As the multiple 'notes' in the previous UIs mention, we need to commit the changes.

This commit will contain all changes including the conflict fixes

![](images/image_thumb_25255B39_25255D1.png)

Once the commit is done:

![](images/image_thumb_25255B40_25255D1.png)

Go back to the Git Bash and push this branch into TeamMentor/Master (I prefer to do these things on a Git Bash)

![](images/image_thumb_25255B41_25255D1.png)

After the push, this is what the TeamMentor/Master graph looks like:

![](images/image_thumb_25255B42_25255D1.png)

...with the 3.4 code now being there:

![](images/image_thumb_25255B43_25255D1.png)

Finally, what we can do now is to issue a Pull Request:

![](images/image_thumb_25255B44_25255D1.png)

... from the**_ 3.4_Merge_** branch:

![](images/image_thumb_25255B45_25255D1.png)

... into the master branch:

![](images/image_thumb_25255B46_25255D1.png)

... which contain all the code changes since the 3.3.3 release

![](images/image_thumb_25255B47_25255D1.png)

With the best part being that this Pull Request can be merged using GitHub's UI (since there are no conflicts)

![](images/image_thumb_25255B48_25255D1.png)

And that's it!

Hopefully this provided a good example of how to use Git and TortoiseGit to easily merge commits and resolve any resulting conflicts.


**Tip: How to delete branches in GitHub:**  

To delete a branch in Github, we do a push from an 'empty branch' into an 'existing branch'

In this case, if I wanted to delete the 3.4_Merge branch at the TeamMentor/Master repository, I would use:

    $ git push git@github.com:TeamMentor/Master.git :3.4_Merge
