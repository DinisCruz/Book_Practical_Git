## Creating o2platform.com website using GitHub Pages (with screenshots of all design options)

In order to set-up a site for the [http://o2platform.com](http://o2platform.com/) domain, I just used GitHub Pages to create and publish a brand new site.

This is what it looks like:

What do you think?

Please see below the other design options and let me know if I made a mistake. Also if you want help in editing this site, ping me with your GitHub account, and I'll give you push access (or fork the [o2platform.github.com](https://github.com/o2platform/o2platform.github.com) repo and send me  pull requests)

**Here is how I created it:**  

I went to the [https://github.com/o2platform/o2platform.github.com](https://github.com/o2platform/o2platform.github.com)** **repo, and on the settings page, I clicked on the **_Automatic Page Generator_**

which opened up this page, where I added the content that is current on this blog's [O2 Platform](http://blog.diniscruz.com/p/owasp-o2-platform.html) page:

When finished I clicked on **_Continue to Layouts_**

And I checkout the multiple design options:

**And finally Dinky**

which was my preferred choice , so I clicked on **Publish**, and here it is in action (using the default domain provided by GitHub)** **

Next step was to set up custom domain, which is explained here:

![](images/Screen_Shot_2013-05-25_at_23_03_00.png)

and is basically a case of creating new file:

Called CNAME, with the contents of the domain

After saving it (and local cache flushed), the GitHub pages now point to [http://o2platform.com](http://o2platform.com/)
