##  Fixing bug in TBot user editor via Git merge of fix developed on another repo's branch 

Here is an example of how I just created a HotFix branch to address an issue we want to push to our live servers asap, and how the fix was developed by Ian in one of this dev branches.

First I created _HotFix _Branch at a (freshly baked) local clone of the **_TeamMentor/Dev_** repository:

Then I reviewed the code from Ian's branch I want to merge:

When happy with the changes, I used a**_ git fetch _**to get the latest version of Ian's fork of **_TeamMentor/Dev_**

Followed by a **_$ git merge Dev_Ian/#437-Password-Expiry HotFix_3_3_1_**  
**_  
_**[![image](images/image_thumb_25255B5_25255D1.png)](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-5GW1axkn5fM/UYQIuh3q6II/AAAAAAAACA4/QVurbdmzcsg/s1600-h/image%25255B17%25255D.png)

Which did the merge with the**_ TeamMentor/Dev_** master branch

A look at GitK confirms that there was only one commit added (the Ian's '[Date value being saved to database](https://github.com/IanIan123/Dev/commit/32bd09708bc60c7e3d7e5e0c6d74a1f3c19c5915)')

At this stage if we look at Ian's network map, we will see that this commit is not linked to another commit (i.e. is the last one of the **_#437-Password-Expiry_** branch

[![image](images/image_thumb_25255B7_25255D1.png)](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-wJD120cUNnc/UYQIy7Zt-QI/AAAAAAAACBY/iyBLQoyvMSg/s1600-h/image%25255B23%25255D.png)

Next step is to quickly test if the feature is working ok.

This fix is for the [Password expiry cannot be set from the main TM GUI](https://github.com/TeamMentor/Master/issues/437) issue  (i.e. make the 'Account Expiration' field editable).

So I opened an user's edit page

changed the expiration date:

Saved it

And confirmed that the user's xml data was changed on the in-memory version of the user xml files:

and on the file system:

My final step is to push the HotFix branch into the live server:

[![image](images/image_thumb_25255B17_25255D1.png)](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-XkWzN0qiyog/UYQI_3W8wlI/AAAAAAAACC4/7S_v932Y36c/s1600-h/image%25255B45%25255D.png)

Here are the commits in the new **_HotFix_3_3_1_** branch (note the Ian's '[Date value being saved to database](https://github.com/IanIan123/Dev/commit/32bd09708bc60c7e3d7e5e0c6d74a1f3c19c5915)' branch is now there)

And now Ian's branch is connected with the new HotFix_3_3_1 branch:

same graph without the branch labels:
