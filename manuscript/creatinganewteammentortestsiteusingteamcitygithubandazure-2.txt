##  Creating a new TeamMentor test site using TeamCity, GitHub and Azure 

Serge just asked me to create a new TeamMentor (TM) website for him using a particular TM library, so here are the steps I took (note: some of this will be automated in the next TM release)  
  
**In Azure .... **  
**  
**It all started by going into Azure and creating a new website:

In this case called tm-hashes

in a couple secs it was available

next I set-up git publishing:

[![image](images/image_thumb_25255B3_25255D1.png)](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-541w6lxDmdc/UUHkAFnWQDI/AAAAAAAAKk0/2RswW1aL3FA/s1600-h/image%25255B11%25255D.png)

using  'Local Git' since that works well with TeamCity and doesn't require that Azure is given pull privileges into the target repo:

[![image](images/image_thumb_25255B4_25255D1.png)](http://lh3.ggpht.com/-zs2T9AoIo-A/UUHkCEcBXUI/AAAAAAAAKlE/bbcWIth5GDI/s1600-h/image%25255B14%25255D.png)

Azure worked for a bit, and after a couple secs I had:

[![image](images/image_thumb_25255B5_25255D1.png)](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-eaGW5OZAcok/UUHkD82_STI/AAAAAAAAKlU/pPf0fj9WsRA/s1600-h/image%25255B17%25255D.png)

**In TeamCity ...**

Next, in the TeamCity server, to make it easier on next deployments, I added this site to one of the builds that already pushes other sites into Azure:

[![image](images/image_thumb_25255B6_25255D1.png)](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-iS7ShpkPmwY/UUHkF6sEfGI/AAAAAAAAKlk/h1LynbwNgz8/s1600-h/image%25255B20%25255D.png)

Specifically I added another build-step similar to the ones already there for tm-vulnerabilities and tm-DennisGroves

[![image](images/image_thumb_25255B7_25255D.png)](http://lh6.ggpht.com/-I62jJfuxJQU/UUHkHbKnB7I/AAAAAAAAKl0/3ADLGx3ct14/s1600-h/image%25255B23%25255D.png)

The easiest way to do it, was to create a copy of one of the existing steps:

[![image](images/image_thumb_25255B8_25255D1.png)](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-kdAOpH8X4P4/UUHkJMTT_fI/AAAAAAAAKmE/EUuCYC9OsIY/s1600-h/image%25255B26%25255D.png)

After editing the 'copied build step', called '_Publish to Azure (tm-Hashes)', _ I quickly reordered the build steps

from: [![image](images/image_thumb_25255B9_25255D1.png)](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-4b00QToV3AQ/UUHkKiBZQAI/AAAAAAAAKmQ/JFAQWo9AMX0/s1600-h/image%25255B29%25255D.png)  to:  [![image](images/image_thumb_25255B10_25255D1.png)](http://lh3.ggpht.com/-kYz_oaoUriI/UUHkMOWFfMI/AAAAAAAAKmk/TlhCJMlKkzw/s1600-h/image%25255B32%25255D.png)

Next, I clicked on Run:

[![image](images/image_thumb_25255B11_25255D1.png)](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-w1reT9LuQfA/UUHkN2VXUQI/AAAAAAAAKm0/h1MSomF-hII/s1600-h/image%25255B35%25255D.png)

in order to trigger a TeamCity build:

[![image](images/image_thumb_25255B12_25255D1.png)](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-hLgnZNX_znc/UUHkPc5ijMI/AAAAAAAAKnA/B5rhfmqCvvM/s1600-h/image%25255B38%25255D.png)

That build will:

  * do a git pull from the latest version of the TM code (currently at 3.3 RC3.01), 
  * build the visualstudio main project, 
  * and push to Azure

  
Here are the bulid logs during the 'push to Azure' step:

At this moment the Azure admin page for the tm-hashes site, will show a '**_Deploying_**' message

[![image](images/image_thumb_25255B14_25255D1.png)](http://lh6.ggpht.com/-I0ZYrsGi5ag/UUHkTDZgVxI/AAAAAAAAKnk/tsWPYEMn3EI/s1600-h/image%25255B44%25255D.png)

which becomes '**_Active Deployment_**' once it is completed:

One of the nice hacks the Azure team did with their git implementation is to provide good messages/info in the git data sent back on pushes (the lines in dark-orange below where created by Azure):

Once the push in complete, we can browse the Azure site:

And see an empty TeamMentor installation:

**  
****In TM Control panel using GitHub zip file ...**  
**  
**The final step is to add the library that Serge wants (note: for this example I'm going to install the library via drag and drop of zip files.)

To get the library files, I went to its private Github Repositor, and clicked on the **_zip_** button

which downloaded the zip file into my current vm:

back in TeamMentor,

I logged in:

as admin

[![image](images/image_thumb_25255B23_25255D.png)](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-O46-tYWwb_Y/UUHkkYO5I2I/AAAAAAAAKpk/-5mYW7GIAzg/s1600-h/image%25255B69%25255D.png)

went to the control panel:

clicked on '**_Advanced Admin Tools'_** and '**_Install/Upload Libraries_**'

[![image](images/image_thumb_25255B26_25255D.png)](http://lh3.ggpht.com/-cUmKO2HwScI/UUHknpAnegI/AAAAAAAAKqE/Whs0gAihdhk/s1600-h/image%25255B78%25255D.png) [![image](images/image_thumb_25255B27_25255D.png)](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-JdwWpd1rO00/UUHkpFiSbEI/AAAAAAAAKqU/mbWi4qcQkGg/s1600-h/image%25255B81%25255D.png)

drag-n-dropped the local zip file into the '**_Upload a file'_** red box

[![image](images/image_thumb_25255B28_25255D.png)](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Kqo7yzTq3VA/UUHkrQwmmvI/AAAAAAAAKqk/50JEAJJtZoY/s1600-h/image%25255B84%25255D.png)

Depending on the network speed, this can take a couple seconds or minutes:

[![image](images/image_thumb_25255B29_25255D.png)](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-QJQo6oXSF44/UUHktKU7W_I/AAAAAAAAKq0/QC0-XJgTIn8/s1600-h/image%25255B87%25255D.png)

Once the upload was completed,

I clicked on the 'Lib_Hashes-master.zip' link that appeared at the top:

[![image](images/image_thumb_25255B30_25255D.png)](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-xjtcviJTIaE/UUHku0IsfVI/AAAAAAAAKrE/gyKAFYDMd1Y/s1600-h/image%25255B90%25255D.png)

waited a little bit:

[![image](images/image_thumb_25255B31_25255D.png)](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-aF-tdgynasA/UUHkwU8udBI/AAAAAAAAKrU/NzWPxWJmKpY/s1600-h/image%25255B93%25255D.png)

and once I saw the success message:

[![image](images/image_thumb_25255B33_25255D.png)](http://lh3.ggpht.com/-sxHwPxewAPk/UUHkxylu4JI/AAAAAAAAKrk/oQXATIjm-ho/s1600-h/image%25255B99%25255D.png)

I clicked on _**Open Main Page**_  
_**  
**_[![image](images/image_thumb_25255B32_25255D.png)](http://lh3.ggpht.com/-nXErGrAqBtU/UUHkzq4LNfI/AAAAAAAAKr0/SrAyb4DVX6k/s1600-h/image%25255B96%25255D.png)

and the main TeamMentor Gui showed the imported libraries:

[![image](images/image_thumb_25255B34_25255D.png)](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-Jr1TAQ6diA0/UUHk1ShtOQI/AAAAAAAAKsA/C0YwfKo57cg/s1600-h/image%25255B102%25255D.png)

The final step was to remove the original temp library (created by TeamMentor on first install)

And finally, I sent Serge an email with the link to his brand new install of TeamMentor :)
