## Great presentation on Git Branching (very similar to the model we are using in TeamMentor) 

Just saw [this presentation on Git Branching](http://www.slideshare.net/lemiorhan/git-branching-model) (embedded below) which is really close to the model we are currently using to manage TeamMentor's app development.

I really agree with just about everything Lemi Ergin says and this is a great description of the power of Git for branching
