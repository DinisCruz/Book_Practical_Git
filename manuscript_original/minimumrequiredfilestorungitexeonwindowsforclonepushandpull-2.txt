##  Minimum required files to run git.exe on windows (for clone, push and pull) 

I want to add native Git support to TeamMentor (and O2) and don't want to ship the entire git folder structure that is installed with [msysgit](http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/)  
  
I found the _[minimal required files to just use git-clone](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/msysgit/BugV7r6eFyY) _post that implies that the only files that are needed for a git clone are :  


  * git-clone.exe 
  * git-fetch-pack.exe 
  * git-index-pack.exe 
  * git.exe 
  * libcurl-4.dll 
  * libiconv2.dll 

Is this correct?

What about for git pushes, pulls and commits?

I'm sure I saw this on a tool I used the other day (which had git support), but I can't remember which one
