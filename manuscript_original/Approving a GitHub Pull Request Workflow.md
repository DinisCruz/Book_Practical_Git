##  Approving a GitHub Pull Request Workflow 

I just received a GitHub's **_Pull Request_** from Roman for some new content that he added to TeamMentor's Documentation Site.

Here is the workflow I used to approve this request using GitHub's web-based workflow:

**1) Receive GitHub email alert:**

**2) Go to GitHub and see the Pull Request there:**

The main page ([https://github.com/TeamMentor/TeamMentor-Documentation/pull/4](https://github.com/TeamMentor/TeamMentor-Documentation/pull/4)) gives us a nice overview of the Pull Request:

Here are the Commits:

On the **_Files Changed _**tab we can easily see (in colours) the proposed changes.

For example, here is a change to the main TM Library xml file with a couple new articles added:

Here are a couple lines removed and some added:

This is a new file:

These are a couple metadata changes:

**3) Approving the Pull request**  

Going back to the first page (the **_Discussion_** tab) the most important part of this whole process is the green bar that shows that this Pull Request can be merged ok

[![](images/Screen_Shot_2012-10-17_at_02_16_44.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rvo2h1oJNEo/UH4HDZKoDaI/AAAAAAAAAHY/wLz2FDV5ALk/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-10-17+at+02.16.44.png)

This basically means that there are no conflicts between the new changes and the current content. When this is not possible (and you get a red bar), the best thing is to do this 'manually' (i.e. via a git bash on your local box)

When you click on the 'Merge Pull Request' button you get this confirmation request:

[![](images/Screen_Shot_2012-10-17_at_02_20_16.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3CJLIk0WRI0/UH4H-npobgI/AAAAAAAAAHg/-kx0ew78vOM/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-10-17+at+02.20.16.png)

And clicking on 'Confirm Merge' will do the commit and close this Pull Request:
