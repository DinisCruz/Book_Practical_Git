##  Script to Git Clone 13 repositories in order to have all TeamMentor Libraries in one folder 

Part of the push for the 3.4 release of [TeamMentor](https://teammentor.net/), I wanted to have a copy of all TeamMentor libraries locally (there are 13 libraries on the 3.4 release).

Since O2 Platform's FluentSharp has native Git support, I was able to do create the clones using this script (note how simple it is to create a clone from a GitHub repo):  
  
  
The script takes about 1m to run:

And the end result is a folder with all libraries cloned:

With each folder containing the git repository for that library

Next, I zipped all these files into the **SI Library --3.4.zip **file **(**note that they all must be on the root of the zip)

Then, on a local QA TM instance, I:

  * went into the admin panel, 
  * chose up upload the zip, 
  * triggered the installation (i.e. unzip) of those libraries
  * rebuilt the cache:

Once that was completed, a reload of the home page shows the 13 libraries:

Including the new **_Html5_** library:

... and the new **_Scala_** library
